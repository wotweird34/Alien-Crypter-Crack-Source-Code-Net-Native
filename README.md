# Ailen Crypter
A crypter constitutes a variant of software adept at encrypting, obscuring, and manipulating malicious software, thus heightening its resistance against identification by security applications. Cyber malefactors employ this tool to fabricate malware capable of eluding security applications by assuming the guise of an innocuous program until its installation is accomplished. Diverse categories of crypters find existence.
